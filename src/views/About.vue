          For anyone wondering the tech behind this site, feel free to check out this page 
          and source code available on my GitHub. You're free to use anything on my site, a free web
          is a better web :).

          No fancy smancy take a trip to francy things going on here, 
          everything you see is built in good ol' HTML, CSS, sparingly used JavaScript and a teensy bit of PHP. 
          The web was founded on the principle of easily accessible information so I enjoy keeping it that way.

          I prefer sticking to 
          technologies that allow users to access my website regardless of how powerful their machine or fast their 
          internet connection is, heck if you can use this site in a PSP browser then I've achieved my goal.
